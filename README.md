<h1>myFlix - FrontEnd application</h1>

This project documents my foray into creating a FrontEnd application, allowing users to create a profile and access my movies api. This project includes React, React-Bootstrap, React-redux, and scss.
My movie API is hosted by Heroku: https://hannah-hogan-movie-api-ea6c47e0093b.herokuapp.com/

Users of this project can create an account and view a display of movies. They can then filter movies based on title, look at more details for each movie, and even add movies to their favorites list! All of their favorites will be stored on their account.
